In this mini-projet, we use Google's MediaPipe framework as well as a pretrained Tensorflow Lite model to predict the face mesh given an image of a mascaron (sculptured keystone). We visualize the reconstructed face in 3D, with skin texture.

The notebook is shown below (please allow nbviewer time to load 18.4 MB) :
